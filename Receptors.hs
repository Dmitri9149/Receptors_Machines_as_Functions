--  we will make calculation with 'clerer indexing' 
-- of course if we rely on indexing 'we do not understand something ...' 
-- and in the tasks we really do not understand somethig 
-- but the clerer indexing is a good and unserstandable exercise 
-- we will name our digits 'spins' in relation with physics 
-- where spin numbers are used actually for the same reasons : 
-- to target interacting particles 

-- in the receptors computations the basic receptors types are very 
-- simple like (), Bool ( 2 valued set) etc.. 
-- this is the same simplicity as a machine register is also very simple : 
-- it keeps only 0 or 1 value.
-- but there are billions on such registers with clever linking between each 
-- other
-- in cell biology our somple receptors are linked by 'clever shaping' 
-- which we will transform in 'clever' indexing 


-- We will mostly model Session machines : machines which implement 
-- Session Types. Such machines are responsible for interaction between 
-- two (or even more) cells. 

-- Some basic types 

-- from Birth / Death (or Rise / Low ) 
-- there are sources and sinks which correspond to value generation
-- and value substitution to functions
-- second elt in (Int, Int) part correspond to reall type (like () or Bool)
-- there is to be function from Int to types 

-- function from Int to Types : there only a few basic Types which are used in 
-- cell machines, so such function may exist 
-- but in Haskell we can not make a function from Int to Types 
-- may be we have to go to Idris 
-- now we will just keep the function in our mind : 
-- 0 -> ()
-- 1 -> Bool 
-- 2 -> Int 
-- ..... yet undefined 

-- from Source to Sink 
-- the length (mass) of the list is to be >= 1
-- the list of length = 1 correspond to a value (totally evaluated function)
-- in this case the fst elt in the pair is the 'coordinate' of the 
-- function which will consume the value
-- if length > 1 the fst elt correspond to 'coordinate' of value 
-- which will be substituted into the function 
-- the snd elt in the pair correspont to the Type of used data 
-- here it is represented by Int number

-- but this is OK ...
