module Receptors where


-- we will make calculation with 'clever indexing' 
-- I name the indexes as spins as in quantum fields theory   
-- where spin numbers are used actually for the same reasons : 
-- to target interactions between particles 

-- in the receptors computations the basic receptors types are very 
-- simple like (), Bool ( 2 valued set) etc.. 
-- this is the same simplicity as a machine register simplicity : 
-- the rigisters  are very simple : they keeps only 0 or 1 value.
-- but there are billions on such registers with very complex linking topology 
-- between them 
-- same way in cell biology our simple receptors are linked by 'clever shaping' 
-- which we will transform in 'clever' indexing -> the indexing will arise from the 
-- topology of interaction 


-- We will start with model of Session machines : machines which implement 
-- Session Types. These are bundles of receptors. Such machines are responsible 
-- for interaction between two (or even more) cells and correspond to 'human made' 
-- values of session Types. 
-- Haskell is used for the modelling ( but later most probably I will switch to Idris)

-- we will construct particles (receptors) and Laws of Univerce : which will be some predicates 
-- to interact (every interaction will be evaluation of some function) the particles 
-- are to correspond to Laws of Universe ; otherwise an interaction is not possible 

-- there will be Action function and principle : collection of results of 
-- interactions at every step, glued by && between each other -> so, in case of an valid 
-- interaction the total result of the collection is to be True 

-- Some basic types 

-- the name is from Birth / Death (or Rise / Low ) 
-- there are sources and sinks which correspond to value generation
-- and value substitution to functions
-- second elt in (Int, Int) part correspond to a Type (like () or Bool or Int)
-- there is to be function from Int to types ( with kind *) to enumerate Types 
-- such function exists because there only a few basic Types which are used in 
-- cell machines, so such function may exist 
-- but in Haskell we can not make a function from Int to Types 
-- (it is possible in Idris)
-- we will just keep the function in our mind : 
-- 0 -> ()
-- 1 -> Bool 
-- 2 -> Int 
-- 3 -> Char
-- 4 -> String 
-- ..... yet undefined 

-- we will do it as function from Int to String 
-- and out type checking for type correspondence will use 
-- checking for equality of strings

-- the length (mass) of the list is to be >= 1
-- the list of length = 1 correspond to a value (totally evaluated function)
-- in this case the fst elt in the pair is the 'coordinate' of the 
-- function which will consume the value
-- if length > 1 the fst elt correspond to 'coordinate' of value 
-- which will be substituted into the function 
-- the snd elt in the pair correspont to the Type of data
